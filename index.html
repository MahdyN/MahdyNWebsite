                Hello there! My name is Mahdy Noureddine, a Biomedical Engineer by trade attempting to enter the tech industry as a Software 
                Engineer.<br>
                It has been my dream to learn how to code and become a developer and this course is a huge step forward for me.
                I was born in Brooklyn but I grew up in Beirut, Lebanon and moved back to New York when I was 19 to attend school at Stony
                Brook University. Recieved my degree and worked in pharma for around 2.5 years but decided that wasn't for me and wanted to 
                change my career. Very excited to share this journey with everyone.
            </p>
